# AGENTS — `<lily-motion-picker>` (HTML helper)

Single source of truth: [spec/index.md](./spec/index.md). Read it first; everything
below is a fast index.

## What this package is

A reusable vanilla HTML/JS headless motion (reduced-motion) picker,
packaged as the `<lily-motion-picker>` custom element. The control is an
**icon button that opens a dropdown listbox** (WAI-ARIA APG listbox
pattern) — not a native `<select>`. On change it applies the chosen
slug to the document root via `data-motion`, with optional
`localStorage` persistence. Its initial value defers to the platform's
`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` media query before falling back to
a fixed default — the one behaviour difference from its
`theme-picker`/`text-size-picker` siblings. Ships no CSS; the consumer
styles the `motion-picker` class hooks and decides what
`[data-motion="reduce"]` actually suppresses.

## Public surface

- Class `MotionPicker extends HTMLElement` (registered as
  `<lily-motion-picker>` on import of `index.ts`).
- Named exports: `MotionPicker`, `motionName`, `nextMotionPickerId`,
  `prefersReducedMotion`, `PAUSE_SIGN`.
- Type exports: `MotionPickerProps`, `MotionPickerChangeDetail`.
- Instance members beyond the attribute mirrors: `open` (getter),
  `listId` (getter), `optionId(index)`, `openList(startIndex?)`,
  `closeList(refocus = true)`, `labelFor(slug)`, and
  `renderButtonContent()` — the overridable rendering hook.

Required attributes: `label`, `motions`.

## Behaviour contract (one paragraph)

On every motion change the element (1) sets `data-motion="{slug}"` on
`target` (default `document.documentElement`), (2) optionally writes
the slug to `localStorage[storageKey]`, and (3) dispatches a
`motionchange` `CustomEvent` carrying the slug. Initial value resolves
from `value` > storage > `default-value` > `(prefers-reduced-motion:
reduce)` (mapped to `"reduce"` / `"no-preference"` when offered) >
`motions[0]`. All DOM writes happen inside `connectedCallback` /
`attributeChangedCallback`, so the element is SSR-safe.

The real selection lives on `this.value` (attribute + property);
consumers read it from there or from the `motionchange` detail. A
`value` change syncs state attributes in place rather than rebuilding
the DOM, because a rebuild while the listbox is open would destroy
focus and the active descendant.

## HTML

`<lily-motion-picker>` contains one rendered
`<div class="motion-picker {class}">` holding, in order: a hidden
`<input name="{name}">` for form participation; a
`<button type="button" class="motion-picker-button" aria-label="{label}"
aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded aria-controls="{listId}">`
whose content defaults to
`<span class="motion-picker-icon" aria-hidden="true">` (U+23F8 + U+FE0E,
exported as `PAUSE_SIGN`); and a
`<ul class="motion-picker-list" id="{listId}" role="listbox"
aria-label="{label}" tabindex="-1" hidden>` with one
`<li class="motion-picker-option" role="option" aria-selected>` per
slug. `aria-activedescendant` sits on the `<ul>` only while open;
`data-active` marks the keyboard-highlighted option, which is a
different thing from `aria-selected`.

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.2 AAA target; WAI-ARIA APG listbox pattern. This helper's
  specific concern is **2.3.3 Animation from Interactions**.
- The keyboard contract is implemented in JS, not inherited from the
  platform. Button: `ArrowDown`/`Enter`/`Space` open, `ArrowUp` opens
  on the last option. List: arrows move and clamp, `Home`/`End` jump,
  `PageUp`/`PageDown` move by ten (clamped), `Enter`/`Space` select
  and refocus the button, `Escape` closes without changing the value,
  `Tab` puts focus on the button first and then closes — without
  cancelling the key, so the default Tab proceeds from the picker's
  position — and printable characters run a 500 ms typeahead where a
  repeated character cycles through its matches and a buffer of
  differing characters refines from the active option.
- Focus sits on the `<ul>` while open, never on an `<li>`; the
  highlighted option is conveyed by `aria-activedescendant`.
- `aria-label` carries the consumer-supplied accessible name on both
  the button and the list. The glyph is `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Option labels default to title-cased slugs; the word "default" is
  never emitted.

## Conventions this package follows

- Vanilla web component (custom element extending `HTMLElement`).
- Light DOM only (no Shadow DOM).
- Strict TypeScript on the public surface.
- No runtime dependencies.
- No bundled CSS, fonts, icons, or images.
- All user-facing strings come from attributes / properties.
- Mirrors the Svelte sibling's §7 acceptance criteria.
- Glyph escaped in source (`PAUSE_SIGN`, U+23F8 + U+FE0E) per
  `AGENTS/helpers.md`'s glyph-escaping rule.
