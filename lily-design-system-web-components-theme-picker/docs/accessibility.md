# Accessibility

The control targets WCAG 2.2 AAA and implements the WAI-ARIA APG
listbox pattern: an icon button that opens a dropdown
`role="listbox"`. It is not a native `<select>`, so none of the
keyboard behaviour comes from the platform — it is all implemented
in JavaScript, and documented in full below.

## Roles and properties

| Element                                | Role / Property                                | Source        |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `<lily-theme-picker>` (host)                | none (transparent)                             | —             |
| `<div class="theme-picker">`           | none (styling root)                            | Element       |
| `<button class="theme-picker-button">` | implicit `role="button"`                       | Browser       |
| `<button>`                             | `aria-label={label}`                           | Consumer attr |
| `<button>`                             | `aria-haspopup="listbox"`                      | Element       |
| `<button>`                             | `aria-expanded="true" \| "false"`              | Element       |
| `<button>`                             | `aria-controls={listId}`                       | Element       |
| `<span class="theme-picker-icon">`     | `aria-hidden="true"`                           | Element       |
| `<ul class="theme-picker-list">`       | `role="listbox"`, `aria-label={label}`         | Element       |
| `<ul>`                                 | `tabindex="-1"`; `hidden` while closed         | Element       |
| `<ul>`                                 | `aria-activedescendant={optionId}` while open  | Element       |
| `<li class="theme-picker-option">`     | `role="option"`, unique `id`, `aria-selected`  | Element       |
| `<li>`                                 | `data-active` when keyboard-highlighted        | Element       |
| `<input type="hidden">`                | none — form participation only                 | Element       |

The host `<lily-theme-picker>` element has no implicit ARIA role. It is
a lifecycle container that holds the rendered control.

### `data-active` is not `aria-selected`

They answer different questions and frequently disagree:

- `aria-selected="true"` — this is the **chosen** theme, the one
  currently applied.
- `data-active` — this is the **keyboard-highlighted** option, the
  one `Enter` would choose. It exists only while the list is open.

Arrowing down from "Light" to "Dark" moves `data-active` to Dark
while `aria-selected` stays on Light until you press `Enter`. Style
them differently, or keyboard users cannot tell where they are from
what they have.

### Focus model

Focus moves to the `<ul>` when the list opens, and never lands on an
individual `<li>`. The highlighted option is conveyed solely through
`aria-activedescendant`, which is what the APG prescribes for a
listbox with a roving active descendant.

Two consequences for consumer CSS:

- Style `.theme-picker-list:focus-visible`, not just the button —
  that is where the focus ring belongs while the list is open.
- Give `.theme-picker-option[data-active]` a clearly visible
  highlight. Without it, a keyboard user gets no visual feedback at
  all as they arrow through the list, because focus is not moving.

## Keyboard contract

Implemented in JavaScript. Nothing here is inherited from the
platform.

### On the button

| Key                 | Action                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`               | Move focus onto the button.                                   |
| `Shift+Tab`         | Move focus backwards off the button.                          |
| `ArrowDown`         | Open the list with the selected option active (else index 0). |
| `Enter`             | Same as `ArrowDown`.                                          |
| `Space`             | Same as `ArrowDown`.                                          |
| `ArrowUp`           | Open the list with the **last** option active.                |

Opening always moves focus to the `<ul>`.

### On the listbox

| Key                 | Action                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArrowDown`         | Move the active option down one. **Clamps** at the last option — no wrapping. |
| `ArrowUp`           | Move the active option up one. Clamps at the first option.    |
| `Home`              | Make the first option active.                                 |
| `End`               | Make the last option active.                                  |
| `Enter`             | Select the active option, apply it, close, return focus to the button. |
| `Space`             | Same as `Enter`.                                              |
| `Escape`            | Close and return focus to the button, **without** changing the theme. |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown` | Move the active option by ten. Clamps at both ends.         |
| `Tab`               | Move focus to the button, then close — without cancelling the key, so the default Tab proceeds from the picker's position rather than restarting from `<body>`. |
| printable character | Typeahead over the option *labels*. The buffer resets after 500 ms of no typing. A single character advances to the **next** match and repeating it cycles onward; a buffer of differing characters refines the match from the active option. Search wraps once. |

Arrow-key movement deliberately clamps rather than wraps. The APG
permits either; clamping means `End` and repeated `ArrowDown` agree,
and a user holding `ArrowDown` lands on the last option instead of
cycling past it.

### Pointer equivalents

- Clicking the button toggles the list.
- Clicking an option selects it, applies it, and closes.
- Clicking outside the rendered root closes the list.
- Focus leaving the root closes the list.

## State signals

The active state is exposed in four independent channels — no
colour-only meaning is required:

1. `aria-selected="true"` on one `<li role="option">`.
2. `data-theme="<slug>"` on the target element (default `<html>`).
3. The `value` attribute / `el.value` property on the host.
4. The hidden `<input>`'s `value`, for form submission.

All four describe the *open* control or the document. The **closed**
button exposes none of them to a user: it shows a glyph and nothing
else.

## Known tradeoffs

The icon-button-plus-listbox design buys a compact, fully-styleable
control. It costs three things, and they are real. All three are the
consumer's to mitigate.

### 1. It is an icon-only control

The accessible name depends **entirely** on `aria-label`, which
comes from the `label` attribute. There is no visible text label at
all. Two consequences:

- A consumer who passes a vague `label` leaves the control unusable
  to screen-reader users. "Theme" is fine; `""` or "Select" is not.
- The control **fails WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name** unless the consumer
  adds a visible label of their own. 2.5.3 requires the accessible
  name to contain the visible label text; with no visible text there
  is nothing to match, and speech-input users have no word to say.

The fix is a visible label next to the control, or button content
that includes text — see
[custom-rendering.md](./custom-rendering.md#recipe-glyph-plus-visible-text).

### 2. A custom listbox is weaker than a native `<select>`

The previous native `<select>` got a great deal for free, all of it
battle-tested in every assistive technology on every platform:
combobox semantics, the platform's own keyboard behaviour, the
native mobile OS picker, and typeahead.

A hand-rolled `role="listbox"` with `aria-activedescendant` is
well-specified by the APG, but:

- Screen-reader support for `aria-activedescendant` is weaker and
  more variable than support for native control semantics,
  particularly across older AT versions.
- Mobile browsers and mobile screen readers vary more.
- There is no native mobile picker UI — on a phone the user gets
  your CSS dropdown, not the OS wheel.

This is a genuine regression in robustness, accepted in exchange for
a control that can be styled and positioned freely. If your audience
skews toward mobile screen-reader users, weigh it seriously.

### 3. Glyph rendering is platform-dependent

The button's glyph is a plain Unicode character — U+25D1 CIRCLE WITH
RIGHT HALF BLACK — with no bundled font, because Lily ships no fonts
or icon assets. It may render as a colour emoji, a monochrome glyph,
or tofu, depending entirely on the platform's installed fonts.

Consumers who need a guaranteed appearance should override
`renderButtonContent()` with their own inline SVG; see
[custom-rendering.md](./custom-rendering.md#recipe-an-inline-svg-icon).

## The status region is the default pattern

Because the closed button shows only a glyph, **the current theme is
not displayed or announced anywhere** unless you surface it. This
guidance is more important now than it was under the old native
`<select>`, not less.

So the control ships paired with a status region. It is in
[`examples/01-basic.html`](../examples/01-basic.html) and in the
`index.md` quick start, so the first thing an adopter copies already
has it. Leaving it out is the deliberate choice — a decision to make
knowingly, with a reason — not something to opt into later:

```html
<lily-theme-picker label="Theme" themes-url="/t/" themes="light,dark"></lily-theme-picker>

<p class="theme-picker-status" aria-live="polite">Active theme: Light</p>

<script type="module">
    await customElements.whenDefined("theme-picker");

    const select = document.querySelector("theme-picker");
    const status = document.querySelector(".theme-picker-status");

    select.addEventListener("themechange", (e) => {
        status.textContent = `Active theme: ${select.labelFor(e.detail.theme)}`;
    });
</script>
```

Why it is shaped this way:

- **Visible, not `sr-only`.** The gap is not screen-reader-only:
  nothing in the closed control indicates the active theme to
  *anyone*. A visible line answers "which theme am I on?" for
  sighted users and helps cognitive accessibility, which is what AAA
  favours. The visually-hidden variant is in
  [styling.md](./styling.md#the-status-region) for designs that
  genuinely cannot spare the space.
- **`aria-live="polite"` announces mutations only**, so the region
  is silent on first paint and speaks once per change. No
  interruption, no page-load chatter.
- **Initial text authored in the markup**, not written by JS at
  startup — a startup write is a mutation, and mutations are what
  the live region announces. Under SSR/SSG, render it from the same
  resolved value you inline as the `value` attribute.
- **`labelFor()` is a public method on the element**, so the status
  line picks up `theme-labels` overrides and translations for free
  and never shows a raw slug.

### What this does and does not fix

It restores the *information*, not the *semantics*. A screen-reader
user tabbing onto the closed button still hears only the label —
"Theme, pop-up button, collapsed" — and must read on to learn the
active value. That is a genuine residual cost of an icon-only
trigger. If your users depend on the control itself announcing its
current value, add visible button text via
`renderButtonContent()`, which puts the value back in the control.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Passing a vague `label`.** It is the entire accessible name of
  an icon-only button.
- **Not adding a visible label anywhere.** That is the WCAG 2.5.3
  failure described above.
- **Adding a redundant `role` on the host element.** The rendered
  button and list already carry the pattern's roles. Overriding them
  produces confusing announcements.
- **Styling `[data-active]` and `[aria-selected]` identically.**
  They mean different things, and a keyboard user needs to see the
  difference.
- **Forgetting `.theme-picker-list:focus-visible`.** While the list
  is open the `<ul>` holds focus; if you only styled the button's
  focus ring, the focus indicator vanishes on open.
- **Hiding options with `display: none`.** That removes them from
  the accessibility tree. The element manages visibility with the
  `hidden` attribute on the list; leave the options alone.
- **Forgetting to translate `theme-labels`.** The control only knows
  what the consumer tells it; locale-aware copy is the consumer's
  responsibility.
- **Wrapping the control in a Shadow DOM.** It uses light DOM;
  placing it inside a closed shadow root breaks `aria-labelledby`
  and `aria-controls` references from outside.

## Visible focus

The control does not suppress `:focus` or `:focus-visible` styling
on either the button or the list. The consumer's CSS is responsible
for the visible focus ring. NHS-UK and Lily™ themes ship a
high-contrast focus outline that meets AAA.

## Reduced motion

The control performs no animation — opening the list is a `hidden`
toggle, nothing more. If you add a transition to the dropdown in
your own CSS, gate it behind `prefers-reduced-motion`. Theme CSS
files are likewise responsible for respecting it if they transition
on the `data-theme` swap.

## Screen-reader smoke test

- VoiceOver (macOS) announces the closed control as "{label},
  pop-up button, collapsed". On open it reads the listbox's label,
  then each option as the active descendant moves.
- NVDA announces "{label} button collapsed", then "{label} list box"
  and the active option.
- Verify explicitly that the *closed* control conveys nothing about
  the active theme — that is expected, and it is what the status
  region exists to cover.

## When subclassing

If you subclass `ThemePicker`, which tier you pick decides who owns
accessibility:

- **Overriding `renderButtonContent()` keeps the whole contract.**
  The base class still builds the button and listbox, so all the
  aria wiring and the entire keyboard contract keep working. Keep
  whatever you return `aria-hidden="true"` if it is decorative.
- **Replacing the rendered DOM transfers the contract to you** —
  every role, every id, every aria attribute, and every keyboard
  key, because the base class's handlers are bound to the DOM it
  built.

See [custom-rendering.md](./custom-rendering.md) for both tiers and
the invariants the second one must preserve.
