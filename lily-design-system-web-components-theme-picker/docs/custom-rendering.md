# Custom rendering

The default rendering is an icon button that opens a dropdown
listbox. When you need something else — your own SVG on the button,
the active theme's name in place of the glyph, a segmented control —
the customisation surface is **subclassing `ThemePicker`**.

The Svelte, React, and Vue siblings pass a `children` snippet /
render prop / slot that replaces the glyph inside the button and
receives `{ value, open, labelFor }`. Custom elements in light DOM
have no equivalent: `<slot>` is a Shadow DOM mechanism, and these
helpers commit to light DOM (see
[`../../AGENTS/conventions.md`](../../AGENTS/conventions.md)). So
the HTML helper offers two tiers instead.

| Tier | Hook                                           | Keeps accessibility | Use when                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `renderButtonContent()`                        | Yes, entirely       | You want different button content — the common case. |
| 2    | Post-process after `super.connectedCallback()` | No — you own it     | You want a fundamentally different structure.        |

**Prefer Tier 1.** It is the only path that cannot break the
accessibility contract.

## Tier 1 — override `renderButtonContent()`

This is the direct analogue of the other frameworks' `children`.
Return any `Node`; it is placed inside the button, replacing the
default `<span class="theme-picker-icon">`.

```ts
import { ThemePicker } from "./lily-design-system-web-components-theme-picker";

class MyThemePicker extends ThemePicker {
  renderButtonContent(): Node {
    const span = document.createElement("span");
    span.textContent = this.labelFor(this.value); // ChildArgs.value + labelFor
    span.dataset.open = String(this.open); // ChildArgs.open
    return span;
  }
}

customElements.define("my-theme-picker", MyThemePicker);
```

```html
<my-theme-picker
  label="Theme"
  themes-url="/assets/themes/"
  themes="light,dark,abyss"
></my-theme-picker>
```

What you get inside the hook — the stand-ins for the `ChildArgs`
the other frameworks pass:

| Member                | Stands in for        | Notes                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `this.value`          | `ChildArgs.value`    | The active slug.                                   |
| `this.open`           | `ChildArgs.open`     | Whether the listbox is open at render time.        |
| `this.labelFor(slug)` | `ChildArgs.labelFor` | Applies `theme-labels`, else title-cases the slug. |

What the base class still owns, unchanged:

- The `<div class="theme-picker">` root and the consumer `class`.
- The button element itself, its `type="button"`, and all of
  `aria-label`, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`.
- The `<ul role="listbox">`, every `<li role="option">`, their ids,
  `aria-selected`, `data-active`, and `aria-activedescendant`.
- The entire keyboard contract.
- The hidden `<input>`, the managed `<link>`, `data-theme`,
  `localStorage`, and the `themechange` event.

### Timing

`renderButtonContent()` re-runs whenever anything it can read
changes, so content derived from `this.value` or `this.open` stays
current without any work on your part. Concretely it is called:

- on every structural rebuild — a change to `themes`,
  `theme-labels`, `label`, `name`, or `class`; and
- on every state sync — a `value` change, and each open or close.

This is what makes the hook behave like the reactive `children`
snippet the Svelte, React, and Vue helpers pass. A value-dependent
button is therefore just the obvious code, with no listener to wire
up:

```ts
class LabelledThemePicker extends ThemePicker {
  renderButtonContent(): Node {
    const span = document.createElement("span");
    span.textContent = this.labelFor(this.value);
    return span;
  }
}
```

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Return a fresh Node each call.** The returned node replaces the
  button's previous children, so don't cache one node and hand back
  the same instance.
- **Don't hang state off the returned node.** If you attach event
  listeners inside `renderButtonContent()` they are discarded with
  the old node on the next call, which is usually what you want; if
  you need durable listeners, attach them to the host element in
  `connectedCallback()` instead.

For purely visual open/closed styling, prefer the CSS selector
`.theme-picker-button[aria-expanded="true"]` over re-rendering on
`this.open` — the base class keeps that attribute in sync and CSS
avoids the DOM churn entirely.

### Recipe: an inline SVG icon

The default glyph is a plain Unicode character with no bundled font,
so it renders differently across platforms and can even come out as
tofu. Supplying your own SVG is the fix:

```ts
class SvgThemePicker extends ThemePicker {
  renderButtonContent(): Node {
    const ns = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
    const svg = document.createElementNS(ns, "svg");
    svg.setAttribute("class", "theme-picker-icon");
    svg.setAttribute("aria-hidden", "true"); // keep it out of the name
    svg.setAttribute("focusable", "false"); // and out of the tab order
    svg.setAttribute("viewBox", "0 0 16 16");
    svg.setAttribute("width", "16");
    svg.setAttribute("height", "16");

    const circle = document.createElementNS(ns, "circle");
    circle.setAttribute("cx", "8");
    circle.setAttribute("cy", "8");
    circle.setAttribute("r", "7");
    circle.setAttribute("fill", "currentColor");
    svg.appendChild(circle);

    return svg;
  }
}
customElements.define("svg-theme-picker", SvgThemePicker);
```

Keep `aria-hidden="true"` on whatever you return. Without it the
graphic can leak into the accessible name and compete with
`aria-label`.

### Recipe: glyph plus visible text

The icon-only default fails WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name unless the
consumer adds a visible label. Returning a fragment with both fixes
that at the source:

```ts
class TextThemePicker extends ThemePicker {
  renderButtonContent(): Node {
    const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();

    const icon = document.createElement("span");
    icon.className = "theme-picker-icon";
    icon.setAttribute("aria-hidden", "true");
    icon.textContent = "◑";
    fragment.appendChild(icon);

    const text = document.createElement("span");
    text.className = "theme-picker-button-text";
    text.textContent = this.label; // matches aria-label — 2.5.3 satisfied
    fragment.appendChild(text);

    return fragment;
  }
}
```

A `DocumentFragment` is a `Node`, so returning one to add several
children works.

## Tier 2 — replacing the whole rendering

`#render()` is a private field and genuinely cannot be overridden —
`#`-private members in JavaScript are not visible to subclasses. A
subclass that wants a different structure must post-process after
the base class has rendered:

```ts
class SegmentedThemePicker extends ThemePicker {
  connectedCallback(): void {
    super.connectedCallback();
    this.#rebuild();
  }

  attributeChangedCallback(
    n: string,
    o: string | null,
    v: string | null,
  ): void {
    super.attributeChangedCallback(n, o, v);
    if (n === "value" || n === "themes" || n === "theme-labels")
      this.#rebuild();
  }

  #rebuild(): void {
    const root = this.querySelector(".theme-picker");
    if (!root) return;
    // … build and install your own structure …
  }
}
customElements.define("segmented-theme-picker", SegmentedThemePicker);
```

**A subclass that does this takes over the entire accessibility
contract.** Be clear-eyed about the scale of that: the base class's
keyboard handling is bound to the DOM the base class built. Replace
that DOM and the keyboard contract goes with it — every arrow key,
`Home`/`End`, `Enter`/`Space`, `Escape`, `Tab`, and the typeahead.
None of it survives on markup the base class does not recognise.

### The invariants Tier 2 must preserve

1. **Keep the `theme-picker` class hook** on whatever root you
   render, or the consumer's CSS hook disappears.
2. **Keep the button/listbox pairing intact**:
   `aria-haspopup="listbox"` on the trigger, `aria-expanded` kept in
   sync with the open state, `aria-controls` pointing at the list's
   `id`, and the list carrying `role="listbox"` with that matching
   `id`.
3. **Keep the accessible name on both the trigger and the list**
   (`aria-label` from `this.label`). An icon-only button with no
   name is unusable.
4. **Every option needs `role="option"`, a unique stable `id`, and
   `aria-selected`**; the list needs `aria-activedescendant`
   pointing at the active option while open, and no
   `aria-activedescendant` at all while closed. Reuse
   `this.listId` and `this.optionId(i)` for the ids.
5. **Keep the glyph (or its replacement) `aria-hidden="true"`** so
   it never becomes the accessible name.
6. **Keep the hidden `<input>`** carrying `this.name` and the
   current value, or form participation breaks — and for
   `<lily-theme-picker>` the managed `<link>` discriminator goes with it.
7. **Re-implement the full keyboard contract**, or reuse
   `openList()` / `closeList()` and drive them yourself from your
   own handlers.
8. **Write the chosen value to `this.value`** and let the base class
   own the apply lifecycle. Never touch `document.head`,
   `data-theme`, or `localStorage` directly, and never dispatch
   `themechange` yourself.

The full keyboard contract you are signing up to re-implement is in
[`../spec/index.md` §6.2](../spec/index.md#62-keyboard-contract).

### If you only need different styling

You almost certainly do not need Tier 2. The class hooks
(`theme-picker`, `-button`, `-icon`, `-list`, `-option`) plus the
`[data-active]` and `[aria-selected]` state selectors cover most
visual redesigns from CSS alone, with zero accessibility risk. See
[styling.md](./styling.md).

## What a subclass should _not_ do

- Don't mutate `document.head`, `data-theme`, or `localStorage`
  directly; let the base class own that lifecycle.
- Don't dispatch `themechange` yourself — the base class fires it on
  every apply, and a second event double-counts.
- Don't add a competing `name` to your controls — use `this.name`.
- Don't remove the `theme-picker` class hook from the root.
- Don't put text into the button without either keeping it
  consistent with `aria-label` or marking it `aria-hidden`.

## Tests for subclasses

Subclass tests live in your own test file (not in
`theme-picker.test.ts`). Assert both halves — that your content
landed, and that the base class's wiring survived:

```ts
class MyThemePicker extends ThemePicker {
  /* … */
}
customElements.define("my-theme-picker", MyThemePicker);

test("renderButtonContent replaces the glyph and keeps the aria wiring", async () => {
  const el = document.createElement("my-theme-picker") as MyThemePicker;
  el.setAttribute("label", "Theme");
  el.setAttribute("themes-url", "/t/");
  el.setAttribute("themes", "light,dark");
  document.body.appendChild(el);

  // Your content replaced the default glyph.
  expect(el.querySelector('[data-testid="custom"]')).not.toBeNull();
  expect(el.querySelector(".theme-picker-icon")).toBeNull();

  // The base class's structure is untouched.
  const btn = el.querySelector<HTMLButtonElement>(".theme-picker-button")!;
  expect(btn.getAttribute("aria-haspopup")).toBe("listbox");
  expect(btn.getAttribute("aria-label")).toBe("Theme");
  expect(
    el.querySelector(`#${btn.getAttribute("aria-controls")}`),
  ).not.toBeNull();
});

test("subclass still fires themechange through the base lifecycle", async () => {
  const el = document.createElement("my-theme-picker") as MyThemePicker;
  el.setAttribute("label", "Theme");
  el.setAttribute("themes-url", "/t/");
  el.setAttribute("themes", "light,dark");
  document.body.appendChild(el);

  let detail;
  el.addEventListener("themechange", (e) => {
    detail = (e as CustomEvent).detail;
  });
  el.value = "dark";
  expect(detail).toEqual({ theme: "dark" });
});
```

The base class's lifecycle continues to fire because
`super.connectedCallback()` runs first — and, for Tier 1, because
you never intercepted the lifecycle at all.

A Tier 2 subclass needs considerably more than this: a test per
keyboard key, per aria attribute, and per open/close path. That
testing burden is itself a reason to prefer Tier 1.
