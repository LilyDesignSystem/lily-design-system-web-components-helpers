# `<lily-locale-picker>` — Specification

Single source of truth for the `lily-design-system-web-components-locale-picker`
HTML helper. This file drives implementation, testing, and
documentation in the spec-driven-development style: anything not in
this spec is out of scope; anything in this spec must be exercised by
a test.

Sibling files in this directory:

- `locale-picker.ts` — the custom-element implementation
- `locale-picker.test.ts` — vitest + jsdom spec exercising every clause in §4–§7
- `locales.ts` — built-in code → English-name table and RTL sets
- `locales.tsv` — canonical 436-row source for `locales.ts`
- `index.ts` — re-export barrel (side-effectfully registers the element)
- `index.md` — user-facing readme

The Svelte sibling
(`lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/lily-design-system-svelte-locale-picker/`)
shares the same numbered acceptance criteria; this spec mirrors §1–§9
re-expressed for the custom-element idiom.

---

## 1. Goal

Give any HTML page a drop-in, headless locale picker that:

1. Renders an accessible **icon button that opens a dropdown
   listbox** of available locales (WAI-ARIA APG listbox pattern).
2. **Applies the chosen locale** by setting `lang="…"` and
   `dir="ltr|rtl"` on the document root (or on a consumer-supplied
   target).
3. Auto-detects script direction (RTL for Arabic, Hebrew, Thaana,
   Mongolian traditional, N'Ko, Syriac, Adlam scripts).
4. Optionally persists the chosen locale to `localStorage`.
5. Optionally falls back to `navigator.languages` on first visit when
   no value, storage, or default is supplied.
6. Ships zero CSS — the consumer styles every visual aspect via the
   `locale-picker` class hooks and the `lang` / `dir` attributes.
7. Provides BCP 47-compliant tag output. Underscores in locale codes
   (e.g. `en_US`) are converted to hyphens (`en-US`) when written to
   the `lang` attribute, per RFC 5646.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Translation**. This helper does not translate strings. It only
  signals the locale to the consumer's i18n library via the `lang`
  attribute, the `localechange` event, and the bindable `value`.
- **Locale negotiation**. The helper does not implement
  `Intl.LocaleMatcher`. A simple prefix-match resolves
  `navigator.languages` against the consumer's `locales` list.
- **Auto-discovery**. The consumer always supplies the list of
  available locale codes.
- **Bundling translation files**. No JSON / YAML / PO assets ship.
- **Positioning the dropdown**. The package ships no CSS, so the
  rendered `<ul>` sits in normal flow until the consumer gives the
  root `position: relative` and the list `position: absolute`.

## 3. Architectural decisions

- **Custom element extends `HTMLElement`.** The tag is
  `<lily-locale-picker>`. The class is exported as `LocalePicker` from
  `locale-picker.ts` and `index.ts`.
- **Side-effectful registration on import.** `index.ts` calls
  `customElements.define("lily-locale-picker", LocalePicker)` on first
  module evaluation, guarded by a `customElements.get(...)` check.
- **Light DOM.** The element renders its `<div>` root, button, and
  listbox as children, not in a shadow root.
- **Icon button + custom listbox, not a native `<select>`.** The
  control is an icon-only `<button>` paired with a
  `<ul role="listbox">`. The keyboard contract (§4.7) is implemented
  in JavaScript following the WAI-ARIA APG listbox pattern; it is not
  inherited from the platform. The accessibility tradeoff this buys
  and costs is stated in `docs/accessibility.md`.
- **A hidden `<input>` preserves form participation.** The rendered
  root contains `<input type="hidden" name="{name}" value="{value}">`
  so the control still submits with a surrounding `<form>`.
- **Stable, SSR-safe ids.** List and option ids come from a
  module-level incrementing counter (`nextLocalePickerId()`, exported)
  — never `Math.random()` or `Date.now()`.
- **The `lang` attribute is the source of truth.**
- **The `dir` attribute is the secondary switch** (auto-detected from
  the locale; can be suppressed with `apply-dir="false"`).
- **BCP 47 hyphen form on the wire.** Locale codes are stored in the
  consumer's array using whichever form they prefer (`en_US`,
  `en-US`, or `en`). When the select writes to the DOM, it
  normalises to the hyphen form. The `value` attribute / property
  mirrors back the original consumer form so round-trips are
  lossless.
- **No dependencies.** `Intl.DisplayNames` is used opportunistically
  if the runtime supports it.

## 4. Public API

### 4.1 Observed attributes

| Attribute               | Type            | Required | Default                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `label`                 | `string`        | yes      | —                             | Accessible name. Applied as `aria-label` to **both** the button and the listbox. The control is icon-only, so this is the only accessible name it has. |
| `locales`               | `string` (CSV)  | yes      | —                             | Available locale codes, comma-separated. The JS property `el.locales` accepts `string[]`.                                                              |
| `value`                 | `string`        | no       | `""`                          | Currently selected locale code (consumer form).                                                                                                        |
| `default-value`         | `string`        | no       | `"en"` if present, else first | Initial locale when nothing else is supplied.                                                                                                          |
| `storage-key`           | `string`        | no       | `undefined`                   | If set, persist the selection to `localStorage` under this key.                                                                                        |
| `detect-from-navigator` | `boolean` attr  | no       | absent / `false`              | If present (and not `="false"`), resolve `navigator.languages` to a supported locale on first visit.                                                   |
| `name`                  | `string`        | no       | `"locale"`                    | `name` attribute on the rendered hidden `<input>`.                                                                                                     |
| `apply-dir`             | `boolean` attr  | no       | absent / `true`               | If set to `"false"`, the select only writes `lang` and never touches `dir`.                                                                            |
| `locale-labels`         | `string` (JSON) | no       | `"{}"`                        | Pretty labels per locale code, JSON-encoded object.                                                                                                    |
| `class`                 | `string`        | no       | `""`                          | Extra CSS class on the rendered `<div>` root.                                                                                                          |

There is no `placeholder` attribute. It was a 0.3.0 mechanism for
pinning a native `<select>`'s displayed text; there is no `<select>`
left to pin.

### 4.2 JS properties and methods

Every attribute in §4.1 mirrors a camelCase JS property, plus:

| Member                         | Kind            | Purpose                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `el.target`                    | property        | `HTMLElement \| null`, default `document.documentElement`; no attribute form (DOM references are not serialisable).  |
| `el.open`                      | getter          | Is the listbox currently open? Read-only.                                                                            |
| `el.listId`                    | getter          | `id` of the rendered `<ul role="listbox">`.                                                                          |
| `el.optionId(index)`           | method          | `id` of the rendered option at `index`.                                                                              |
| `el.openList(startIndex?)`     | method          | Open the listbox. `startIndex` overrides which option starts active; the default is the selected option, or index 0. |
| `el.closeList(refocus = true)` | method          | Close the listbox. Returns focus to the button unless `refocus` is `false`.                                          |
| `el.labelFor(code)`            | method          | Resolve a locale code to its display label (§5.4).                                                                   |
| `el.tagFor(locale)`            | method          | Resolve a locale code to its BCP 47 tag (§5.1).                                                                      |
| `el.optionLang(code)`          | method          | The `lang` claim for one option — the BCP 47 tag when the label is the derived endonym, else `""` (§5.4).            |
| `el.renderButtonContent()`     | **overridable** | Build the button's content. See §4.8.                                                                                |

`labelFor`, `tagFor`, `optionLang`, and `renderButtonContent` are
public so that subclasses can use and override them; the rest of the
rendering is held in private fields and cannot be overridden (§4.8,
tier 2).

### 4.3 Lifecycle callbacks

- `static get observedAttributes()` lists the kebab-case attributes
  in §4.1.
- `connectedCallback()` resolves the initial value (per §5.2),
  renders the children, registers the outside-click listener, and
  applies the locale.
- `attributeChangedCallback(name, _old, _new)` updates the
  corresponding internal field and then either **rebuilds** the DOM
  (`locales`, `locale-labels`, `label`, `name`, `class`) or, for
  `value`, only **syncs state** and re-applies (see §5.7).
- `disconnectedCallback()` removes the document click listener and
  clears the typeahead timer. It does not unset `lang` / `dir` —
  those attributes are author-managed once they have been set.

### 4.4 Events

The element fires a `localechange` `CustomEvent` after every applied
change. `event.detail` is `{ locale: string }` (the consumer-form
code, not the BCP 47-normalised tag). The event bubbles and is
composed.

### 4.5 DOM contract

```html
<lily-locale-picker label="Locale" locales="en,fr,ar">
  <div class="locale-picker {class}">
    <input type="hidden" name="locale" value="en" />
    <button
      type="button"
      class="locale-picker-button"
      aria-label="Locale"
      aria-haspopup="listbox"
      aria-expanded="false"
      aria-controls="locale-picker-1-list"
    >
      <span class="locale-picker-icon" aria-hidden="true"
        >🌐︎</span
      >
    </button>
    <ul
      class="locale-picker-list"
      id="locale-picker-1-list"
      role="listbox"
      aria-label="Locale"
      tabindex="-1"
      hidden
    >
      <li
        class="locale-picker-option"
        id="locale-picker-1-option-0"
        role="option"
        aria-selected="true"
        data-active
        lang="en"
      >
        English
      </li>
      <li
        class="locale-picker-option"
        id="locale-picker-1-option-1"
        role="option"
        aria-selected="false"
        lang="fr"
      >
        français
      </li>
      <li
        class="locale-picker-option"
        id="locale-picker-1-option-2"
        role="option"
        aria-selected="false"
        lang="ar"
      >
        العربية
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</lily-locale-picker>
```

Contract points:

- The rendered root is a `<div>` carrying the `locale-picker` class
  hook plus the consumer's `class` attribute, mirrored from the host.
- The default button glyph is **U+1F310 GLOBE WITH MERIDIANS**
  followed by **U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15**
  (`🌐︎`), exported as `GLOBE_WITH_MERIDIANS`. VS15
  requests the text presentation so the glyph renders monochrome
  rather than as a blue colour emoji, matching theme-picker's ◑
  (U+25D1, which needs no selector). It is wrapped in
  `<span class="locale-picker-icon" aria-hidden="true">` so it can
  never become the accessible name; the name comes from the button's
  `aria-label` alone.
- `aria-controls` on the button points at the list's `id`; the list
  carries `role="listbox"`, the same `aria-label`, and `tabindex="-1"`
  (focus moves to the list, never to an individual option).
- The list carries `hidden` while closed and `aria-expanded` on the
  button tracks the same state.
- `aria-activedescendant` appears on the `<ul>` **only while open**
  and points at the active option's `id`.
- `data-active` marks the active (keyboard-highlighted) option;
  `aria-selected` marks the chosen one. **They are different
  things** — the active option follows the arrow keys, the selected
  option is the applied locale.
- Each option's default text is the locale's **endonym** (§5.4), and
  an `<li>` carries `lang="{tagFor(locale)}"` (BCP 47 hyphen form)
  **only when its text is that derived endonym**, so assistive
  technology pronounces the name in its own language and is never
  handed a consumer-supplied or English-fallback label under a
  foreign `lang` claim. The button and the `<ul>` carry **no
  `lang`** — they are not locale-specific.
- Option and list ids come from `nextLocalePickerId()`, so multiple
  instances on one page never collide.
- The hidden `<input>` carries `name` and the current value, so the
  control participates in form submission.

`lang` and (by default) `dir` are set on the resolved target on every
apply.

### 4.6 Re-exports

`index.ts` exports:

- `LocalePicker` (the class)
- `bcp47LocaleTag`, `isRtlLocale`, `localeName`, `localeEndonym`,
  `matchNavigatorLanguage` (pure helpers)
- `nextLocalePickerId` (the id counter)
- `GLOBE_WITH_MERIDIANS` (the default button glyph)
- `defaultLocaleLabels`, `RTL_LANGUAGE_TAGS`, `RTL_SCRIPT_SUBTAGS`
  (re-exports from `./locales`)
- `type LocalePickerProps`, `type LocalePickerChangeDetail`

### 4.7 Keyboard contract

Implemented in JavaScript per the WAI-ARIA APG listbox pattern. The
platform provides none of it.

On the **button**:

| Key                             | Action                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`             | Move focus into / out of the control. The button is the only tab stop.                            |
| `ArrowDown` / `Enter` / `Space` | Open the listbox with the currently-selected option active (or index 0 when nothing is selected). |
| `ArrowUp`                       | Open the listbox with the **last** option active.                                                 |

Opening moves focus to the `<ul>`.

On the **listbox**:

| Key                     | Action                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` | Move the active option one step. **Clamps** at both ends — no wrapping.                                                                       |
| `Home` / `End`          | Jump to the first / last option.                                                                                                              |
| `Enter` / `Space`       | Select the active option, apply it, close, and return focus to the button.                                                                    |
| `Escape`                | Close and return focus to the button **without** changing the value.                                                                          |
| `PageUp` / `PageDown`   | Move the active option ten steps up / down. Clamps at both ends.                                                                              |
| `Tab`                   | Close and move on — focus goes to the button first, without cancelling the key, so the browser's default Tab proceeds from the picker's position. Hiding the focused list first would drop focus to `<body>` and restart Tab from the top of the document. |
| printable character     | Typeahead over the option **labels**; the buffer resets after 500 ms of no typing. A single character advances to the **next** match and repeating it cycles onward; a buffer of differing characters refines the match from the active option. Search wraps once. |

Pointer and focus behaviour:

- Clicking an option selects it, applies it, and closes the list.
- Clicking the button toggles the list.
- Clicking outside the rendered root closes the list.
- Focus leaving the rendered root closes the list.

### 4.8 Custom rendering

Light DOM has no `<slot>` (that is a Shadow DOM mechanism), so
subclassing is the customisation surface. There are two tiers; the
full guide is [`../docs/custom-rendering.md`](../docs/custom-rendering.md).

**Tier 1 — override `renderButtonContent(): Node`.** This is the
HTML-helper equivalent of the `children` snippet / render-prop /
`ChildContent` the other frameworks pass. Whatever `Node` it returns
is placed inside the button, replacing the default
`<span class="locale-picker-icon">`. `this.value`, `this.open`, and
`this.labelFor(...)` stand in for the `ChildArgs` those frameworks
supply. The base class still builds the button and the listbox, so
the aria wiring and the whole keyboard contract keep working. **This
is the recommended path** — it is the only one that cannot break
accessibility.

**Tier 2 — replace the rendering wholesale.** `#render()` is a
private field and genuinely cannot be overridden; a subclass that
wants a different structure must post-process after
`super.connectedCallback()` / `super.attributeChangedCallback()`. A
subclass that does this **takes over the entire accessibility
contract**, including the keyboard contract, because the base class's
handlers are bound to the DOM it built. The invariants such a
subclass must preserve are enumerated in
[`../docs/custom-rendering.md`](../docs/custom-rendering.md).

## 5. Behaviour

### 5.1 BCP 47 tag normalisation

`bcp47LocaleTag(locale)` replaces every `_` with `-`. No case
normalisation is applied. `el.tagFor(locale)` is the public
instance-level wrapper.

### 5.2 Initial value resolution

On first `connectedCallback` in the browser, the initial locale is the
first non-empty value of:

1. The `value` attribute (if non-empty).
2. `localStorage.getItem(storageKey)` (only if `storage-key` is set
   and the read does not throw).
3. `matchNavigatorLanguage(navigator.languages, locales)` (only if
   `detect-from-navigator` is set) — see §5.3.
4. The `default-value` attribute.
5. `"en"` if present in `locales`, else `locales[0]`.
6. `""` (no apply happens — the select waits for user interaction).

### 5.3 Navigator-language matching

When `detect-from-navigator` is set, the helper inspects
`navigator.languages` (falling back to `[navigator.language]`) and
matches each entry against `locales` in order:

1. Exact match (treating `-` and `_` as equivalent, case-insensitive).
2. Language-only match: if `nav` is `xx-YY`, try the first `locales`
   entry whose language part equals `xx`.

### 5.4 Default labels and the `lang` attribute

Default option labels are endonyms — each language named in itself,
"Cymraeg" not "Welsh" — resolved by the exported `localeEndonym()`
via `Intl.DisplayNames` asked *in that language*. The user who needs
a language menu is the one who cannot read the page's language, and
the exonym means nothing to them. The endonym lookup is deterministic
(no `navigator` dependency), so server and client render the same
label; it returns `""` when the runtime has no data or merely echoes
the tag back.

When `localeLabels[code]` is missing, `el.labelFor(code)` resolves:

1. `localeEndonym(code)`, if non-empty.
2. `defaultLocaleLabels[code]` from the built-in English `locales.ts`
   table — a fallback for runtimes without `Intl.DisplayNames` data.
3. `Intl.DisplayNames` for the consumer's environment locale, if
   available and non-empty. (Opportunistic; never throws.)
4. The raw `code`.

The resolved label is both the option's visible text and the string
the typeahead (§4.7) searches.

Each option's `lang` attribute is a claim about the language of the
option's **text**, and is made only when the text is the endonym we
derived (`el.optionLang(code)`): then a screen reader may correctly
switch voice. A consumer label's language is unknown, and the English
fallback is English, so those options carry no `lang` — the English
word "Arabic" must never be handed to an Arabic speech engine.

### 5.5 Applying a locale

Applying a locale `code` performs, in order:

1. Resolve the target element (default `document.documentElement`).
2. Set `target.lang = bcp47LocaleTag(code)`.
3. If `apply-dir` is not `"false"`, set
   `target.dir = isRtlLocale(code) ? "rtl" : "ltr"`.
4. If `storage-key` is set, write `code` to `localStorage` inside a
   try/catch.
5. Dispatch `localechange` `CustomEvent` with
   `detail: { locale: code }` (consumer-form code).

Applying is **idempotent**: a locale already applied is a no-op, so none
of the steps above repeat and no `localechange` event is dispatched.
`attributeChangedCallback` fires on every `setAttribute("value", …)`,
unchanged value included, so without this a consumer whose listener
mirrors the value back onto the element re-enters apply forever.
Disconnecting clears the record, so a re-connected element applies
again.

### 5.6 RTL detection

`isRtlLocale(locale)` returns `true` when:

1. The locale string contains one of the RTL script subtags as a
   case-insensitive `-`- or `_`-separated component:
   `Arab`, `Hebr`, `Mong`, `Nkoo`, `Syrc`, `Thaa`, `Adlm`. **OR**
2. The leading language subtag is one of: `ar`, `arc`, `ckb`, `dv`,
   `fa`, `he`, `iw` (legacy Hebrew), `ji` (legacy Yiddish), `ks`,
   `ku`, `mzn`, `ps`, `sd`, `ug`, `ur`, `yi`.

### 5.7 Reactivity

Two distinct update paths:

- **A `value` change never rebuilds the DOM.** Rebuilding while the
  listbox is open would destroy focus and the active descendant, so
  `value` only updates the state-carrying attributes — the hidden
  input's `value`, `aria-expanded`, `hidden`,
  `aria-activedescendant`, and each option's `aria-selected` /
  `data-active` — and then re-applies the locale.
- **A structural change rebuilds.** `locales`, `locale-labels`,
  `label`, `name`, and `class` recreate the rendered children. A
  rebuild cannot preserve focus inside the listbox, so it closes the
  list first.

### 5.8 SSR / no-JS

The element only registers in browsers with `customElements`. Without
JS, the element renders nothing. Consumers wanting flicker-free first
paint should set `lang` / `dir` on the document manually before
upgrade. The id counter is deterministic, so ids do not differ
between a server render and a client upgrade.

## 6. Accessibility

### 6.1 Roles and properties

- The rendered root `<div>` has no role; it is a styling container.
- The `<button>` carries `aria-label={label}`,
  `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded`, and `aria-controls`.
- The `<ul>` carries `role="listbox"`, `aria-label={label}`,
  `tabindex="-1"`, and — while open — `aria-activedescendant`.
- Each `<li>` carries `role="option"`, a unique stable `id`,
  `aria-selected`, and `lang="{tagFor(locale)}"` (WCAG 3.1.2
  Language of Parts).
- The glyph span is `aria-hidden="true"`.
- The document root receives `lang` (WCAG 3.1.1 Language of Page)
  and `dir` for bidi layout.
- Focus sits on the `<ul>` while the list is open, never on an
  individual option; the active option is conveyed by
  `aria-activedescendant`.

### 6.2 Keyboard contract

See §4.7. It is implemented in JavaScript, not inherited from a
native control.

### 6.3 Known tradeoffs

Three, stated in full in
[`../docs/accessibility.md`](../docs/accessibility.md):

1. **Icon-only control.** The accessible name depends entirely on
   `aria-label`. There is no visible text label, so a vague `label`
   leaves the control unusable to screen-reader users, and the
   control fails WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name unless the consumer adds a
   visible label of their own.
2. **Custom listbox < native `<select>`.** The previous native
   `<select>` got combobox semantics, platform keyboard behaviour,
   mobile OS pickers, and typeahead for free, battle-tested in every
   AT. A hand-rolled listbox is well-specified by the APG but has
   weaker and more variable support across screen readers and mobile
   browsers, and gets no native mobile picker UI.
3. **Glyph rendering is platform-dependent.** The glyph is a plain
   Unicode character with no bundled font (Lily ships no fonts or
   icon assets). It may render as colour emoji, a monochrome glyph,
   or tofu depending on platform fonts — the globe varies a lot.
   Consumers needing a guaranteed appearance should override
   `renderButtonContent()` with their own SVG.

Because the closed button shows only a glyph, the active locale is
not visible anywhere in the control. Surfacing it in visible text or
a polite live region is the documented default pattern, not an
optional extra.

### 6.4 Internationalisation

- `label`, `localeLabels`, and the consumer-supplied `locales` list
  are all passed through verbatim.
- No user-facing strings are hardcoded.
- Default option names are endonyms, and an option carries its own
  `lang` context exactly when its text is that endonym (§5.4) — a
  screen reader announces "Français" with a French voice even when
  the surrounding page is English, and is never handed an English
  label under a foreign `lang` claim.

## 7. Testing acceptance criteria

`locale-picker.test.ts` must assert every numbered item below. Tests
run under vitest + jsdom, and each test name starts with its clause
number. Numbering mirrors the Svelte sibling's §7.

### 7.1 Markup contract (§4.5)

1. The rendered root is a `<div class="locale-picker">` containing a
   `<button type="button">` with `aria-haspopup="listbox"`,
   `aria-expanded="false"`, and an `aria-controls` that resolves to
   the rendered `<ul role="listbox">`. The button's content is
   `<span class="locale-picker-icon" aria-hidden="true">` carrying
   U+1F310 GLOBE WITH MERIDIANS + U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (two
   codepoints), and `GLOBE_WITH_MERIDIANS` exports
   that same codepoint.
2. `aria-label` is the supplied `label`, on **both** the button and
   the listbox.
3. One `<li role="option">` per entry in `locales`, and a hidden
   `<input type="hidden">` carrying the supplied `name` and the
   resolved value. No placeholder option and no `<select>` element
   is rendered.
4. The listbox carries `hidden` and `tabindex="-1"` until the button
   is activated, after which `hidden` is gone and `aria-expanded` is
   `"true"`. Exactly one option is `aria-selected="true"` — the
   active locale. Clicking an option selects it, applies it
   (`lang`), closes the list, resets `aria-expanded` to `"false"`,
   and updates the hidden input's value.
5. An option whose label is the derived endonym carries
   `lang="{tagFor(locale)}"` (BCP 47 hyphen form); the button and the
   `<ul>` carry no `lang`. (When `lang` may be claimed at all is
   §7.31.)
6. The visible option text is `localeLabels[code] ??
localeEndonym(code) ?? defaultLocaleLabels[code] ??
Intl.DisplayNames ?? code` — endonyms by default (§5.4).

### 7.2 Pure helpers (§5.1, §5.6)

7. `bcp47LocaleTag("en_US")` === `"en-US"`.
8. `bcp47LocaleTag("zh_Hant_TW")` === `"zh-Hant-TW"`.
9. `bcp47LocaleTag("en")` === `"en"`.
10. `isRtlLocale("ar")`, `isRtlLocale("he_IL")`, and
    `isRtlLocale("uz_Arab_AF")` are all `true`.
11. `isRtlLocale("en")` and `isRtlLocale("fr_CA")` are both `false`.
12. `localeName("en_US")` returns `"English (United States)"` from
    the built-in table.

`matchNavigatorLanguage`'s exact-match and language-only-fallback
unit tests sit in the same group; they exercise §5.3 directly and
carry no separate clause number.

### 7.3 Locale application (§5.5)

13. After mount, `target.lang` (defaulting to
    `document.documentElement`) is the BCP 47 form of the resolved
    initial locale.
14. After mount, `target.dir` is `"rtl"` for an RTL initial locale
    and `"ltr"` otherwise (default `apply-dir`).
15. When `apply-dir="false"`, the `dir` attribute is not written.
16. Selecting a different option updates `target.lang`, updates
    `target.dir`, and fires `localechange` with the new locale code
    in its consumer form.
17. A custom `target` element receives `lang` and `dir` instead of
    `document.documentElement`.

### 7.4 Initial-value resolution (§5.2, §5.3)

18. When `storage-key` is set, the active code is written to
    `localStorage` and read back on a fresh mount.
19. When `value` is supplied as a non-empty attribute, the
    initial-value resolution skips storage, navigator detection, and
    defaults.
20. When `detect-from-navigator` is set and `navigator.languages`
    contains a supported locale, the select resolves to it.
21. When `detect-from-navigator` is set and only a language-only
    match is available, the select resolves to that match.

### 7.5 Element shape + property API (§4.2)

22. Setting `el.locales` as an array property mirrors the CSV
    attribute and re-renders.
23. Setting `el.localeLabels` as an object property mirrors the JSON
    attribute and re-renders; the consumer's `class` is appended to
    the root class hook (`class="locale-picker my-picker"`); and
    option ids are unique across multiple instances on one page.

### 7.6 Keyboard contract (§4.7)

24. On the button, `ArrowDown`, `Enter`, and `Space` each open the
    listbox; opening moves focus to the `<ul>` and makes the
    selected option active (`aria-activedescendant` on the list plus
    `data-active` on the option); `ArrowUp` opens with the **last**
    option active.
25. On the listbox, `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` move the active
    descendant and **clamp** at both ends without wrapping;
    `Home` / `End` jump to the first / last option.
26. `Enter` selects the active option, applies it, closes the list,
    returns focus to the button, and removes
    `aria-activedescendant`; `Space` does the same.
27. `Escape` closes without changing the locale and returns focus to
    the button; `Tab` closes the list (its focus contract is §7.30).
28. A printable character runs a typeahead over the option labels
    and moves the active descendant; a click outside the rendered
    root closes the listbox.

### 7.7 Custom rendering by subclass (§4.8)

29. A subclass overriding `renderButtonContent()` replaces the
    default glyph — the `locale-picker-icon` span is gone and the
    returned node sits inside `button.locale-picker-button` — while
    `aria-haspopup`, `aria-label`, and a resolvable `aria-controls`
    all survive, and `this.value`, `this.open`, and
    `this.labelFor(...)` are readable from inside the override. The
    hook re-runs on every structural rebuild **and** on every state
    sync (a `value` change, each open and close), so derived content
    never goes stale. The subclass still fires `localechange`
    through the base lifecycle.

### 7.8 Accessibility hardening (§5.4, §4.7)

These clauses mirror the canonical Svelte spec's §7.28–§7.32; this
port's own §7.28–§7.29 were already taken above, so they continue the
local sequence instead.

30. `Tab` from the open list puts focus on the button before closing,
    so the default Tab proceeds from the picker's position.
31. `lang` is claimed only when the label is the endonym;
    consumer-labelled options carry no `lang` (§5.4).
32. A repeated typeahead character cycles through its matches; a
    buffer of differing characters refines the match from the active
    option.
33. `PageUp` / `PageDown` move the cursor by ten, clamped.
34. An empty list opens without `aria-activedescendant`.

### 7.9 Idempotent apply (§5.5)

35. A listener that mirrors the value back onto the element does
    not re-enter apply: the event fires once per changed value.

## 8. Out-of-scope (future, not implemented here)

- A `<locale-view>` companion element.
