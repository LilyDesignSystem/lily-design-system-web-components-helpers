# Changelog — `<lily-locale-picker>` (HTML helper)

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/)
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-26

Fixed: **a pointer click on the button opened and instantly closed the
popup**, making it unusable with a mouse. A trusted click targets the
icon `<span>`; opening runs the state sync, whose `replaceChildren()`
on the button content detaches that span mid-event, so when the same
click bubbled to the document, the outside-click containment check saw
a detached target, judged the click "outside", and closed the popup on
the very click that opened it. Synthetic `button.click()` targets the
button element, which survives the swap — which is why the whole suite
stayed green over it. The handler now judges the click by its
`composedPath()` snapshot, which is immune to mid-event re-renders,
and a regression test clicks the icon span and asserts the popup
stays open (confirmed to fail without the fix).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-30

First published release. Nothing earlier shipped, so the
accessibility hardening completed after the initial entry below is
part of 0.1.0 rather than a later version.

### Pointer-selection close audited (2026-07-31)

#### Unchanged

- The pointer-selection contract was audited across all seven catalogs
  after a report that a selection might leave the listbox open. This
  catalog already specified *and* asserted the close (`§7.4` — "clicking
  an option selects it, applies it, and closes the listbox", with both
  `hidden` and `aria-expanded` checked), so it needed no change; the
  other six were brought up to it.

### Idempotent apply (2026-07-31)

#### Fixed

- **Applying the same locale twice is now a no-op**, so `localechange` fires
  once per changed value rather than once per apply.
  `attributeChangedCallback` runs on every `setAttribute("value", …)` —
  unchanged value included — so a listener that mirrored the value back
  onto the element re-entered apply without limit, re-writing the DOM and
  re-dispatching until the stack blew. Disconnecting clears the record,
  so a re-connected element applies again. Ported from the canonical
  Svelte helper, which had the same defect through its reactive effect.

### Accessibility hardening (2026-07-29/30)

#### Changed

- **`Tab` from the open list no longer strands keyboard focus.** The
  handler hid the list while it had focus; the browser then moved focus
  to `<body>` and the default Tab restarted from the top of the
  document. Focus now goes to the trigger button first — without
  cancelling the key — so the default Tab proceeds from the picker's
  own position.
- **Typeahead follows the APG single-character rule.** A single
  character advances to the *next* matching option, and repeating that
  character cycles through the matches; only a buffer of differing
  characters refines the match anchored on the active option.
  Previously a character that matched the active option went nowhere.

#### Added

- **`PageUp` / `PageDown`** move the active option by ten, clamped —
  an APG-optional key for long lists.

#### Fixed

- Opening with an empty option list no longer points
  `aria-activedescendant` at an id that does not exist. (`openList()`
  used to refuse to open at all with zero options; it now opens an
  empty listbox with no active descendant, matching the canonical
  Svelte helper.)

#### Changed (labels)

- **Default option labels are endonyms** — each language named in
  itself, "Cymraeg" not "Welsh" — via the new exported
  `localeEndonym()` (`Intl.DisplayNames` asked *in that language*,
  deterministic, no `navigator` dependency). The English table in
  `locales.ts` becomes a fallback for runtimes without the data. The
  user who needs a language menu is the one who cannot read the page's
  language, and the exonym means nothing to them.
- **`lang` on an option is now a claim we can stand behind.** It is set
  only when the label is the derived endonym. Previously every option
  carried `lang` while showing an English label, sending screen-reader
  speech engines to the wrong voice — the English word "Arabic" read
  out by an Arabic synthesizer.

### Initial entry — 2026-07-21

First release under the name `lily-design-system-web-components-locale-picker`.
The version resets to 0.1.0 because this package name has never been
published; a renamed package carries no release history.

#### Added

- `<lily-locale-picker>` custom element: a headless BCP 47 locale control.
  It renders an icon button (🌐, U+1F310 GLOBE WITH MERIDIANS) that
  opens a WAI-ARIA APG listbox of locales. Light DOM only; ships no CSS.
- On each applied locale it sets `lang` (hyphenated BCP 47) and `dir`
  (`ltr`/`rtl`, auto-detected per script) on `target` (default
  `document.documentElement`), optionally persists to
  `localStorage[storageKey]`, and dispatches a `localechange`
  `CustomEvent`. It performs no translation.
- Class hooks `locale-picker`, `locale-picker-button`,
  `locale-picker-icon`, `locale-picker-list`,
  `locale-picker-option`.
- Named exports including `LocalePicker`, `localeName`,
  `matchNavigatorLanguage`, `nextLocalePickerId`; types
  `LocalePickerProps`, `LocalePickerChangeDetail`.

#### Changed

- Renamed from `lily-design-system-web-components-locale-select`. The custom
  element is `<lily-locale-picker>` (was `<lily-locale-picker>`), the class is
  `LocalePicker` (was `LocalePicker`), and the class hooks are
  `locale-picker*` (were `locale-picker*`). Behaviour is unchanged.

Previously released in-tree as `lily-design-system-web-components-locale-select`;
that history is preserved below and did not ship under the current
package name.

---

## Prior history — released in-tree as `lily-design-system-web-components-locale-select`

### Unreleased

#### Changed (BREAKING)

- **The control is no longer a native `<select>`.** It is now an
  **icon button that opens a dropdown listbox**, implementing the
  WAI-ARIA APG listbox pattern. The rendered root is a
  `<div class="locale-picker {class}">` containing a hidden
  `<input>`, a `<button class="locale-picker-button">` whose content
  defaults to `<span class="locale-picker-icon" aria-hidden="true">`
  carrying U+1F310 GLOBE WITH MERIDIANS, and a
  `<ul class="locale-picker-list" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"
hidden>` with one `<li class="locale-picker-option" role="option"
aria-selected lang="{tag}">` per locale.
- **`placeholder` is REMOVED** — attribute, property, and the
  `locale-picker-placeholder` class hook. It was a 0.3.0 mechanism
  for pinning a native `<select>`'s displayed text; there is no
  `<select>` left to pin. The "closed control always reads the
  placeholder word" tradeoff is gone with it.
- **Class hooks changed.** Added: `locale-picker-button`,
  `locale-picker-icon`, `locale-picker-list`. Removed:
  `locale-picker-placeholder`. `locale-picker` now names the `<div>`
  root (was the `<select>`); `locale-picker-option` now names an
  `<li>` (was an `<option>`).
- **Consumers must now supply positioning CSS.** The package ships
  no CSS, so the `<ul>` renders in normal flow until the root gets
  `position: relative` and the list `position: absolute`. Without it
  the dropdown pushes page content around every time it opens. All
  examples carry the minimum block; `examples/02-styling.html` is
  the reference.
- **New keyboard contract**, implemented in JS rather than inherited
  from the platform. Button: `ArrowDown` / `Enter` / `Space` open
  with the selected option active, `ArrowUp` opens with the last
  option active, and opening moves focus to the `<ul>`. List: arrows
  move the active option and **clamp** (no wrapping), `Home` / `End`
  jump to the ends, `Enter` / `Space` select and return focus to the
  button, `Escape` closes without changing the value, `Tab` closes
  without stealing focus back, and printable characters run a 500 ms
  typeahead over the option labels. Clicking outside the root, or
  focus leaving it, closes the list.
- **Reactivity change**: a `value` change no longer rebuilds the
  rendered DOM. Rebuilding while the listbox is open would destroy
  focus and the active descendant, so `value` only syncs the
  state-carrying attributes and re-applies. Structural attributes
  (`locales`, `locale-labels`, `label`, `name`, `class`) still
  rebuild, and close the list first.
- **Accessibility tradeoffs changed shape.** Three now apply, and
  they are documented in full in `docs/accessibility.md`: the
  control is icon-only, so `label` is the only accessible name it
  has and WCAG 2.5.3 Label in Name needs a visible label of the
  consumer's own; a hand-rolled listbox has weaker and more variable
  assistive-technology support than the native `<select>` it
  replaced and gets no native mobile picker; and the Unicode glyph
  renders as colour emoji, a monochrome glyph, or tofu depending on
  platform fonts. The compensating status region is more useful than
  before, not less — the closed button shows only a glyph.

#### Added

- **The default glyph gains U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15.**
  `GLOBE_WITH_MERIDIANS` is now `"\u{1F310}\uFE0E"` (two codepoints,
  was one). VS15 requests the _text_ presentation; without it
  browsers select the colour-emoji font and the globe renders blue,
  which did not match theme-picker's monochrome ◑. Verified in
  Chromium. Consumers comparing against the constant are unaffected;
  consumers hardcoding `"\u{1F310}"` in an equality check should
  import the constant instead.
- `renderButtonContent(): Node` — the overridable rendering hook,
  and this framework's stand-in for the `children` snippet / render
  prop / `ChildContent` the other Lily helpers accept. Whatever it
  returns replaces the default glyph inside the button; `this.value`,
  `this.open`, and `this.labelFor(...)` stand in for `ChildArgs`, and
  the hook re-runs on every structural rebuild _and_ every state sync
  (a `value` change, each open and close) so derived content tracks
  state the same way a reactive snippet would. The
  base class keeps the aria wiring and the whole keyboard contract,
  making this the only customisation path that cannot break
  accessibility. Note it re-runs on structural rebuilds only, not on
  a bare `value` change.
- Public listbox surface on the class: `open` (getter), `listId`
  (getter), `optionId(index)`, `openList(startIndex?)`,
  `closeList(refocus = true)`, plus `labelFor(code)` and
  `tagFor(locale)` promoted from private.
- New exports from `index.ts`: `GLOBE_WITH_MERIDIANS` (the default
  button glyph) and `nextLocalePickerId()` (the module-level id
  counter behind `listId` / `optionId`, deterministic and SSR-safe —
  no `Math.random()` or `Date.now()`).
- `data-active` on the keyboard-highlighted option, distinct from
  `aria-selected` on the applied one, and `aria-activedescendant` on
  the `<ul>` while open.
- A hidden `<input type="hidden" name="{name}">` inside the rendered
  root, preserving form participation now that there is no
  `<select>`.
- `docs/custom-rendering.md` — the two subclassing tiers, the
  `renderButtonContent()` recipes (SVG icon, visible text for WCAG
  2.5.3, live-updating button label), and the eight invariants a
  tier-2 subclass must preserve.

#### Unchanged

- Every attribute except `placeholder`; the `localechange`
  `CustomEvent` (same `{ locale }` detail, still `bubbles: true,
composed: true`); `lang` / `dir` application; BCP 47 normalisation;
  RTL detection; `localStorage` persistence; navigator detection;
  initial-value resolution; the exported pure helpers; per-option
  `lang` for WCAG 3.1.2; and SSR safety.

#### Renamed (examples)

- `examples/01-default.html` → `examples/01-basic.html`, matching
  theme-picker's `01-basic.html` so the two helpers offer the same
  entry-point example under the same name. Inbound links in
  `examples/README.md` and `docs/accessibility.md` updated.
- `examples/01-radios.html` → `examples/01-default.html`.
- `examples/02-select.html` → `examples/02-styling.html`.

The last two were named for rendering models the element no longer
uses. (`03-buttons.html` keeps its name: it is a tier-2 subclass that
really does render a button group.)

#### Added (docs)

Docs brought to parity with theme-picker, so the two helpers offer
the same file shape. Written for locale-picker rather than
copy-pasted:

- `docs/attributes-reference.md` — field-by-field reference for every
  attribute and property, including the inverted `apply-dir` boolean
  and the four-step label fall-through.
- `docs/styling.md` — the five class hooks, the
  `[data-active]` vs `[aria-selected]` distinction, the `hidden`
  trap, per-script font tuning keyed off the `lang` each option
  carries, and why logical properties are mandatory in a control that
  writes `dir` to its own container.
- `docs/recipes.md` — task-shaped snippets: server-side
  `Accept-Language` negotiation reusing the exported
  `matchNavigatorLanguage`, cookie persistence, endonym labels,
  scoped `target` preview, cross-tab sync.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — symptom-first fixes, including the
  RTL-positioning failure unique to this control.

theme-picker's topic-specific docs (`preloading.md`) have no locale
counterpart and were not invented; locale-picker's
(`bcp47.md`, `rtl.md`, `concepts.md`, `i18n-integration.md`) stay.

### 0.3.0 — 2026-07-20

#### Changed (BREAKING)

- The closed `<select>` now always reads a placeholder word instead
  of the active locale name, so the control stays as narrow as that
  word. The element renders a component-owned placeholder
  `<option class="locale-picker-option locale-picker-placeholder" value="" selected>`
  as the first child of the `<select>`, before the real options and
  before any consumer-supplied custom option rendering. The
  placeholder carries no `lang` — it is not a locale.
- **DOM contract change**: the `<select>` now has
  `locales.length + 1` options (was `locales.length`), and the
  option `value` list is `["", ...locales]` (was `locales`).
  Per-option `lang` assertions shift by one index.
- **DOM contract change**: the rendered `<select>`'s own `value` is
  always `""` and no longer tracks the selection. On `change` the
  element reads the chosen code, snaps `select.value` back to `""`,
  and assigns the host's `value`. Read the selection from
  `el.value` or the `localechange` detail — never from the rendered
  `<select>`.
- **Accessibility tradeoff**: a screen-reader user no longer hears
  the active locale announced as the combobox value. Consumers who
  need it should surface the active locale in visible text or a
  polite live region — see `docs/accessibility.md`. The target's
  `lang` / `dir` are still written, so AT pronunciation is
  unaffected.

#### Added

- `placeholder` attribute / property (optional, string). Text of the
  placeholder option; defaults to `label`, keeping the package free
  of hardcoded user-facing strings. Observed, so changing it
  re-renders.
- `index.md` documents the `.locale-picker-placeholder` class hook
  and a `field-sizing: content` / `max-width` width recipe.

#### Unchanged

- `value` remains the real selection; `lang` / `dir` application,
  `localStorage` persistence, navigator detection, the
  `localechange` event, and initial-value resolution all behave
  exactly as before.

#### Added (examples & docs)

- The compensating status region is now the **default pattern**, not a
  suggestion: the entry-point example and the `index.md` quick-start both
  ship a visible `<p class="locale-picker-status" aria-live="polite">`
  showing the active locale via the exported `localeName`.
  `aria-live="polite"` announces mutations only, so it stays silent on
  first paint and speaks on each change. `docs/accessibility.md`
  reframes opting _out_ as the deliberate choice and keeps an explicit
  "what this does and does not fix" note — the region announces
  transitions, it does not restore combobox value semantics.

### 0.2.0 — 2026-07-03

#### Changed (BREAKING)

- Migrated from the radio-group "picker" rendering to a native
  `<select>` (landed in-tree 2026-06-17): the root element is now
  `<select class="locale-picker">` with one `<option class="locale-picker-option">`
  per choice, replacing the former `<fieldset role="radiogroup">` with
  `<input type="radio">` children. The package was renamed from the
  `*-picker` name to `*-select` accordingly.
- Class-hook contract changed: `locale-picker` now names the `<select>` root
  and `locale-picker-option` is the only sub-class; the radio/label sub-class
  hooks are gone.
- Keyboard interaction is the native `<select>` contract (Arrow keys,
  Home / End, first-letter typeahead) instead of radio-group cycling.
- Custom rendering (snippet / render prop / slot / template) now renders
  `<option>` elements inside the `<select>`.

#### Unchanged

- The behaviour contract: DOM application (`lang` / `dir`), optional
  `localStorage` persistence, SSR safety, and the no-hardcoded-strings
  i18n rule are as in 0.1.0.

### 0.1.0 — 2026-06-05

Initial release. Ported from the Svelte canonical
`lily-design-system-svelte-locale-picker`. The DOM contract,
behaviour, and acceptance criteria match the canonical clause-for-
clause.

#### Added

- `<lily-locale-picker>` custom element extending `HTMLElement`.
- Side-effectful registration in `index.ts`, guarded by
  `customElements.get("lily-locale-picker")` for idempotence.
- Required attributes: `label`, `locales` (CSV).
- Optional attributes: `value`, `default-value`, `storage-key`,
  `detect-from-navigator`, `name`, `apply-dir`, `locale-labels`
  (JSON), `class`.
- Mirroring JS properties for every observed attribute.
- `el.locales`: `string[]` getter / setter — CSV-encoded in the
  attribute.
- `el.localeLabels`: `Record<string, string>` getter / setter —
  JSON-encoded in the attribute.
- `el.target`: `HTMLElement | null` — JS-only (no attribute form).
- `localechange` `CustomEvent` (`bubbles: true, composed: true`)
  with `detail: { locale: string }`.
- Pure exports: `bcp47LocaleTag`, `isRtlLocale`, `localeName`,
  `matchNavigatorLanguage`.
- Reference exports: `defaultLocaleLabels`, `RTL_LANGUAGE_TAGS`,
  `RTL_SCRIPT_SUBTAGS`.
- Type exports: `LocalePickerProps`, `LocalePickerChangeDetail`.
- Built-in 436-row English-name table (`locales.ts`, sourced from
  `locales.tsv`).
- Acceptance criteria in `spec/index.md` §7; one vitest test per clause
  in `locale-picker.test.ts`.
- Documentation: `docs/concepts.md`, `docs/accessibility.md`,
  `docs/bcp47.md`, `docs/rtl.md`, `docs/ssr.md`,
  `docs/i18n-integration.md`.
- Examples: 10 self-contained `.html` files under `examples/`
  covering the default `<select>`, custom `<select>` styling,
  buttons, RTL, NHS-style banner, FormatJS, native `Intl.*`, SSR
  cookie pre-seed, scoped target, and combobox.

#### Conventions

- Light DOM rendering — no Shadow DOM.
- One rendered `<select class="locale-picker {class}"
aria-label="{label}" name="{name}">` per select.
- Each `<option>` carries its own `lang` for WCAG 3.1.2 (Language of
  Parts) pronunciation hints.
- `<html lang="{tag}">` (BCP 47 hyphen form) on
  `el.target ?? document.documentElement` on every successful
  apply.
- `<html dir="{ltr|rtl}">` written by default; suppressed when
  `apply-dir="false"`.
- `localStorage` persistence opt-in via `storage-key`; read / write
  errors silently swallowed.
- Navigator detection opt-in via `detect-from-navigator`; simple
  exact-then-language match, not RFC 4647 best-fit.
- Initial value resolves from
  `value > localStorage > navigator > default-value > "en" >
locales[0]`.

#### Spelling note

The HTML catalog uses `bcp47LocaleTag` (American style, no
hyphenated capitalisation) to match DOM-API convention. The Svelte
canonical uses `bcp47LocaleTag` too — both packages agree on this
one. Other helper names mirror the Svelte canonical exactly:
`isRtlLocale`, `localeName`, `matchNavigatorLanguage`.

#### Subclassing for custom rendering

Custom rendering happens by extending the `LocalePicker` class and
overriding `connectedCallback` / `attributeChangedCallback`
(private methods cannot be overridden). The base class keeps
owning the lifecycle (`lang` / `dir` writes, `localStorage`,
`localechange` event).
