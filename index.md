# Lily Design System™ — Web Components Helpers

> **Provenance.** This catalog is a maintainer-directed (2026-09-03) independent copy of
> [`lily-design-system-html-helpers`](../lily-design-system-html-helpers/), which is itself
> already six vanilla custom elements. It differs in tag prefix — `<lily-theme-picker>`
> rather than `<theme-picker>`, matching the Web Components headless catalog — and in
> package naming. Nothing ports between the two automatically: a change to one must be
> applied to the other deliberately. The Svelte catalog remains canonical for contracts.

A catalog of opinionated, reusable vanilla HTML + JavaScript helper
**web components (custom elements)** that sit alongside the headless
[`lily-design-system-web-components-headless`](../lily-design-system-web-components-headless/)
library. Where the headless library ships pure HTML snippets,
these helpers wrap a complete lifecycle (selection + persistence +
DOM application) for one small, common job — and ship that lifecycle
as a registered custom element you drop into any page.

Most helpers own a **user preference**. `<lily-share-picker>` owns an
**action** instead: it applies nothing to the document and persists
nothing, but it owns its interaction end to end and ships the same
headless contract. `<lily-date-time-picker>` is a third shape again — a
**form control**: like `<lily-share-picker>` it persists nothing, but unlike
every other helper here it collects a value a form submits, via a text
field plus a WAI-ARIA APG Date Picker Dialog rather than a preference
listbox.

## Catalog

| Helper                                                                                    | Custom element        | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`lily-design-system-web-components-theme-picker`](./lily-design-system-web-components-theme-picker/)         | `<lily-theme-picker>`     | Pick a visual theme; dynamic CSS load + `data-theme` swap.                                    |
| [`lily-design-system-web-components-locale-picker`](./lily-design-system-web-components-locale-picker/)       | `<lily-locale-picker>`    | Pick a BCP 47 locale; sets `lang` + `dir` on the document root.                               |
| [`lily-design-system-web-components-text-size-picker`](./lily-design-system-web-components-text-size-picker/) | `<lily-text-size-picker>` | Pick a text size; sets `data-text-size` on the document root.                                 |
| [`lily-design-system-web-components-motion-picker`](./lily-design-system-web-components-motion-picker/)       | `<lily-motion-picker>`    | Pick a motion (reduced-motion) preference; sets `data-motion` on the document root, defaulting to the OS's own `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` signal. |
| [`lily-design-system-web-components-share-picker`](./lily-design-system-web-components-share-picker/)         | `<lily-share-picker>`     | Share the page: native share sheet, or a disclosure list of your destinations + copy the URL. |
| [`lily-design-system-web-components-date-time-picker`](./lily-design-system-web-components-date-time-picker/) | `<lily-date-time-picker>` | Pick a date, a time, or both: a typeable field plus a WAI-ARIA APG Date Picker Dialog. |

The catalog parent shares its own `AGENTS/` and `AGENTS/shared/`
directories with conventions, testing, accessibility, and SSR rules,
plus the Lily™-wide headless / i18n / theme principles ported from
the root canonical AGENTS files.

Shared design decisions across the catalog:

- **Web components**: each helper is a custom element extending
  `HTMLElement`, registered via `customElements.define(...)` on
  module import. Consumers can simply `import` the module; no
  explicit register call is needed (importing the class without the
  side-effect from `<kebab>.ts` is also supported).
- **Light DOM**: the custom element itself uses light DOM (not
  Shadow DOM), so the consumer's CSS reaches the rendered markup
  via stable kebab-case class hooks.
- **One rendering shape per pattern**: the three preference helpers
  render an icon button that opens a `role="listbox"` dropdown,
  implementing the WAI-ARIA APG listbox keyboard contract in JS.
  `<lily-share-picker>` is the deliberate exception — its items are links,
  so it is a **disclosure** with real `<a>` elements, no `role`
  override, and real focus movement rather than
  `aria-activedescendant`. Because light DOM has no `<slot>`, the
  customisation surface in every helper is subclassing — override
  `renderButtonContent()` to replace the button glyph without giving
  up the accessibility contract.
- **Attribute-driven config**: attributes are kebab-case strings
  (`themes-url`, `storage-key`, `default-value`, `apply-dir`).
  Array-valued options (`themes`, `locales`) accept either a
  comma-separated attribute (`themes="light,dark,abyss"`) or a JS
  property assignment (`el.themes = ["light", "dark", "abyss"]`) for
  consumers who need ergonomic native arrays.
- **CustomEvent for change notifications**: every helper dispatches
  bubbling, composed `CustomEvent`s (`themechange`, `localechange`,
  `share` / `copy` / `nativeshare`, and `date-time-picker`'s
  `datetimechange` / `shortcut` / `invalidinput`) carrying a
  strongly-typed `detail` object. No `update:value` pattern — the
  element's attribute / property is the source of truth. Where a member
  cannot be an attribute because it carries a function — `<lily-share-picker>`'s
  `targets` and its three callbacks, `<lily-date-time-picker>`'s `labels`,
  `shortcuts`, `isDateDisabled`, `formatValue`, `parseInput`, and its
  three callbacks — it is exposed as a JS property and paired with an
  event where one applies, which is the primary contract.
- **TypeScript** on the public surface; types exported from
  `index.ts`.
- **Headless**: no bundled CSS, fonts, icons, or images. Consumer
  styles every visual aspect.
- **i18n-clean**: every user-facing string comes from an attribute
  or property.
- **One job per helper**: each helper owns the entire lifecycle of
  one user-preference dimension (theme, language, etc.) and composes
  cleanly with the others.
- **Spec-driven**: every helper has a `spec/index.md` numbered with §
  references; tests assert against those numbers; docs link back.

## Vanilla web-component idioms used throughout

The helpers commit to a small set of platform features:

- `class extends HTMLElement` for every helper. No
  `customElements.define("ce", X, { extends: "div" })` "customised
  built-in" path — that path is Safari-hostile.
- `static get observedAttributes()` enumerates the watched kebab-case
  attributes. `attributeChangedCallback(name, old, value)` reacts to
  every change.
- `connectedCallback()` resolves the initial value (per spec §5) and
  renders.
- `disconnectedCallback()` runs deliberate cleanup (e.g.
  garbage-collecting the managed `<link>` only when no other select
  with the same `name` remains in the document).
- JS-property setters: kebab-case attributes are mirrored by
  camelCase JS properties (`label`, `themesUrl`, `defaultValue`,
  `storageKey`). Array / object properties (`themes`,
  `themeLabels`, `locales`, `localeLabels`) accept native
  `Array<string>` / `Record<string, string>` and round-trip through
  the matching string-encoded attribute (CSV for arrays, JSON for
  objects).
- `CustomEvent` for change notifications: `bubbles: true`,
  `composed: true`, `detail` typed via an exported helper type
  (`ThemePickerChangeDetail`, `LocalePickerChangeDetail`).
- Imperative DOM mutation in the element body — no template
  libraries, no Shadow DOM, no string templating helpers.

These choices map 1:1 to the Svelte canonical helpers so behaviour
and tests stay in lock-step across frameworks.

## Differences from the headless library

The HTML headless library mirrors the canonical 490-component
catalog. Each entry is a static HTML snippet plus a minimal
initialisation hook. A consumer typing on top of `theme-picker.html`
from `lily-design-system-web-components-headless` writes their own radio
markup, their own persistence, and their own dynamic loading.

The helpers in this directory are higher-level: they own the
lifecycle, they own the dynamic loading or attribute application,
and they expose a smaller, more opinionated API surface — one
custom-element tag per helper. Both layers can coexist in one page;
the helpers are not a replacement.

## Differences from the Svelte / Vue helpers

The Svelte helpers in
[`../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/`](../lily-design-system-svelte-helpers/)
share the same specification numbering and the same default
behaviour. The Vue helpers in
[`../lily-design-system-vue-helpers/`](../lily-design-system-vue-helpers/)
are a direct port of the Svelte canonical for Vue 3.

The Web Components helpers are the framework-free counterpart: a single import
registers the custom element, after which the element behaves
identically — no `bind:value` (Svelte) and no `v-model:value`
(Vue), just an attribute that mirrors a JS property and a
`CustomEvent` for change notifications.

Differences between this catalog and the Svelte canonical:

| Concept               | Svelte canonical                         | HTML port (custom element)                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Two-way binding       | `bind:value`                             | Read/write `el.value` / `el.setAttribute("value", …)`                               |
| Reactive state        | `$state`, `$bindable`                    | Internal `#private` fields + `attributeChangedCallback`                             |
| Reactive side-effects | `$effect`                                | `connectedCallback` + `attributeChangedCallback`                                    |
| Render props / slots  | Snippet (`{#snippet children(...)}`)     | Subclass the element class, override `renderButtonContent()`                        |
| Stylesheet head       | `<svelte:head>`                          | Imperative `document.head.appendChild(...)`                                         |
| Change notification   | `onchange` prop callback                 | `CustomEvent("themechange" / "localechange")`                                       |
| SSR                   | `hooks.server.ts` + `transformPageChunk` | Static-site generator (Eleventy / Astro / Hugo) renders attributes, client upgrades |
| Storybook             | `*.stories.svelte`                       | Static `.html` files in `examples/`                                                 |
| File ext              | `.svelte`                                | `.ts` (class) + `.html` (examples)                                                  |

The DOM contract and behaviour are otherwise identical; the tests
match clause-for-clause.

## Testing

Each helper ships a vitest suite that runs under jsdom. The
acceptance criteria are listed in each `spec/index.md` §7 and the test
file matches one `it(...)` per numbered item, named with the section
number for fast cross-referencing.

```bash
cd lily-design-system-web-components-theme-picker
pnpm test
```

The shared rules around test setup (jsdom, mounting custom elements,
`attributeChangedCallback` timing, `CustomEvent` capture) live in
[`AGENTS/testing.md`](./AGENTS/testing.md).
