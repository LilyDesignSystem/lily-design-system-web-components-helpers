# Changelog

All notable changes to `lily-design-system-web-components-share-picker` are
documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this package uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-26

Fixed: **a pointer click on the button opened and instantly closed the
popup**, making it unusable with a mouse. A trusted click targets the
icon `<span>`; opening runs the state sync, whose `replaceChildren()`
on the button content detaches that span mid-event, so when the same
click bubbled to the document, the outside-click containment check saw
a detached target, judged the click "outside", and closed the popup on
the very click that opened it. Synthetic `button.click()` targets the
button element, which survives the swap — which is why the whole suite
stayed green over it. The handler now judges the click by its
`composedPath()` snapshot, which is immune to mid-event re-renders,
and a regression test clicks the icon span and asserts the popup
stays open (confirmed to fail without the fix).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-30

First published release. Nothing earlier shipped, so the
accessibility hardening completed after the initial entry below is
part of 0.1.0 rather than a later version.

### Accessibility hardening (2026-07-29/30)

#### Changed

- **`Tab` from the open list no longer strands keyboard focus.** The
  handler hid the list while it had focus; the browser then moved focus
  to `<body>` and the default Tab restarted from the top of the
  document. Focus now goes to the trigger button first — without
  cancelling the key — so the default Tab proceeds from the picker's
  own position.

#### Added

- The list carries the picker's accessible name (`aria-label` =
  `label`), matching the sibling pickers' listboxes: a screen reader
  entering the list hears what it is for, not just "list, three items".

### Initial entry — 2026-07-21

First release under the name `lily-design-system-web-components-share-picker`.
The version resets to 0.1.0 because this package name has never been
published; a renamed package carries no release history. Port of the
canonical Svelte helper `lily-design-system-svelte-share-picker` to a
vanilla custom element.

#### Added

- `<lily-share-picker>` custom element: a single-glyph trigger (➤, U+27A4)
  that opens the native share sheet where the browser provides one, and
  otherwise a disclosure list of consumer-supplied destinations plus an
  optional copy-the-URL action.
- Observed attributes `label`, `url`, `share-title`, `text`,
  `copy-label`, `copied-label`, `copy-failed-label`, `strategy`,
  `class`, each with a mirrored camelCase property.
- Property-only `targets`, `onShare`, `onCopy`, `onNativeShare`, each
  callback paired with a bubbling, composed `CustomEvent` (`share`,
  `copy`, `nativeshare`).
- Public methods `openList`, `closeList`, `items`, `currentUrl`, and the
  overridable `renderButtonContent()` hook standing in for the slot the
  other frameworks expose.
- Pure helpers `canShareNatively()`, `canCopy()`, `nextSharePickerId()`,
  and the `BLACK_RIGHTWARDS_ARROWHEAD` glyph constant, exported from
  both the module and the barrel.
- 52 vitest + jsdom cases mapped onto the §7 acceptance clauses, plus
  coverage of the catalog idiom (attribute/property mirroring, the
  `#render` / `#syncState` split holding focus, listener cleanup, SSR
  import safety).

#### Changed

- Renamed from `lily-design-system-web-components-share-button`. The custom
  element is `<lily-share-picker>` (was `<lily-share-picker>`), the class is
  `SharePicker` (was `SharePicker`), and the class hooks are
  `share-picker*` (were `share-picker*`).
- **The trigger's class is now `share-picker-button`**, matching the
  `{helper}-button` convention the sibling helpers use. Under the old
  name it was `share-picker-trigger`, a documented exception made
  because `.share-button-button` read badly; the rename removes the
  reason for the exception, and the exception is removed with it.
- The `share-title` attribute keeps its name. `title` is a global HTML
  attribute and an `HTMLElement` property, so observing it would paint
  a tooltip over the control and shadow a platform member — the reason
  is unchanged by the rename.
- Event names are unchanged: `share`, `copy`, `nativeshare`.

Previously released in-tree as `lily-design-system-web-components-share-button`
at 0.1.0; nothing shipped under the current package name.

#### Notes

- No social-network endpoints ship with this package, and there is no
  default copy label — both are deliberate. See `spec/index.md` §2.
- Nothing is persisted and nothing is applied to the document root: this
  helper owns an action, not a user preference.
- Two forced deviations from the cross-framework API: the share title is
  `share-title` / `shareTitle` because `title` is a global HTML
  attribute, and `targets` is property-only because `ShareTarget.href`
  is a function. Both are documented in `spec/index.md` §4.1 and §4.3.
