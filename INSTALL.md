# Install

This repository is a Lily Design System subproject.

It is published as a `git subtree` from the canonical Lily Design System™
monorepo at <https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system>. Issues and pull requests are handled there.

Full documentation and the searchable component catalog: <https://lilydesignsystem.github.io/>

## Run this example application

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system-web-components-helpers.git
cd lily-design-system-web-components-helpers
npm install
npm run dev
```

It ships three required routes — `/`, `/components` (the full searchable catalog),
and `/components/{slug}` (a live demo per component) — plus composed-page
demonstrations. The stylesheet targets Lily's kebab-case class names directly, with
no CSS-framework dependency; the current visual reference is the NHS UK design
system.

Lily is not affiliated with or endorsed by NHS.
